IONiseR v2.0.x
==============

Changes:

* Moved away from data.table to tibble. Hopefully resolves some indexing 
    issues.
* Added readFast5Log() to extract process log from fast5 file.
* Re-named @rawData to @eventData (and relevant accessor methods), now fast5
    files can have truly raw data.
* Added fast5toFastq() function to allow access to FASTQ entries without
    reading all the other data.
* Many changes to cope with the variety of fast5 file structure -
    error handling should be more robust now.

Changes:

* Bug fixes to handle different subsetting introduced by combinations of
    dplyr, tibble, and data.table
